### Geography

I live in the city of Manchester, in the United Kingdom.

### Reading

Three of my favorite books are:

- *Forty Rules of Love* by Elif Shafak
- *Reclaim your Heart* by Yasmin Mogahed
- *Orientalism* by Edward Said

### Food

Last night I dreamt about eating in these restaurants:

1. Dishoom in Manchester.
2. Fresh in Germany.
3. Roosters in Slough.

### Contact

The best way to get in touch with me is [on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/sakibmoghal).




And as **imagination** bodies forth,
The forms of things *unknown*, the poetâ€™s pen,
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing,
A local *habitation* and a **name**.
